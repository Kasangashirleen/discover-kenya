          Remember that one time you visited an attraction site only to end up
          wishing it had gone better? Let me guess, it was because you didn't
          know anything about the place.<br></br> Well, now Tembea Kenya has got
          your back! Everything you need to know about where you want to go in
          order to experience 100% of the place. Pictures, directions, weather ,
          nearby facilities, and peoples experience and much more all a few
          clicks away.
